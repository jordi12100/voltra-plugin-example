# SYOPSIS
This is an example of a plugin for voltra.

# DESCRIPTION
Plugins are totally dangerous and a lot of fun. They should be used with
caution. They have complete access to everything and can do anything.

There are a bunch of events that you can listen to. In this example we listen
to the audio data to create a primitive audio visualization plugin.

For more detailed information about events exposed by the API read the docs
located [`here`](https://voltra.co/docs/developers/).
